Coefficient - represents the mean change in the response variable for one unit of change in the predictor variable while holding the predictor in the model constant. When the y value increases the x value decreases. 

The intercept (often labeled as the constant) is the expected mean value of "y"


## Part 2

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) difference between two continuous variables. 

__Mean Absolute Error (MAE)__
